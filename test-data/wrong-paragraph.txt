“That was a "memmorable" day to me, for it "mde" great changes in me. But it is the same with any life.
Imagine one "s12eleted" day "stu%ck" out of it, and think how different its course would have been.
Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of "th" long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers,
that would "nevsdfser" have bound you, but for the "rmation" of the first link on one memorable day.”
